The first use of Lorem ipsum is uncertain, though some have suggested the 1500s, when sections of 
Classical works were often used as dummy texts by printers to make type specimen books demonstrating 
different fonts. According to this account, the material was chosen based on Latinâ€™s
familiarity as a lingua franca across Europe and the popularity of Classical works during the Middle 
Ages. Whenever it was first created, Lorem ipsum did not gain widespread popularity until the 1960s, when 
 Letraset manufactured preprinted transfer sheets that featured the passage for use in the advertising 
 industry. The sheets allowed typesetters and designers to cut out and rub on the text in various fonts, 
 sizes, and formats for mock-ups and prototypes.
