In the 1980s, during the rise of the personal computer, Aldus Corporation developed its PageMaker desktop 
publishing software, which included Lorem ipsum as a word processing feature. Other word processors, 
including Microsoft Word, adopted the feature, and it became ubiquitous as a placeholder in Web design. 
Most Web content management systems, such as Joomla! and Wordpress, also feature a plug-in that generates 
Lorem ipsum.
